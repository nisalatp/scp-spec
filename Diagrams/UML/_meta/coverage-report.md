**Status**: 100% Coverage

## Use Cases
All 44 Use Cases (`UC-01` to `UC-44`) have corresponding diagrams in `UML/UseCases` or `Docs/Diagrams/UseCases`.

## Critical Components
*   **GIS**: Covered in `UML/component` (replacing previous lapse).
*   **Routing**: Covered in `UML/component`.
*   **Simulation**: Covered in `UC-21` flows.
*   **Forms**: Admin/Import flows covered in `UML/sequence`.

## Lapses
All architectural lapses previously affecting coverage (GIS/DataMesh) satisfy the coverage requirements now.
