# SCP-SPEC-VISION-02: Goals and Non-Goals

## Purpose

This document defines what SCP explicitly aims to achieve and what it intentionally does not attempt to solve, ensuring clarity of intent and preventing scope creep.

## In Scope / Out of Scope

**In Scope**
- Governed community data management
- Multi-stakeholder collaboration with strict boundaries
- Country-specific deployment with shared global principles

**Out of Scope**
- Acting as a universal data warehouse
- Providing ideological or policy recommendations
- Replacing operational decision-making by humans

## Definitions

- Goal: A strategic outcome SCP is designed to enable.
- Non-Goal: An area SCP explicitly avoids addressing.

## Rules (MUST/SHOULD/MAY)

- SCP MUST prioritize governance and compliance over convenience.
- SCP MUST support extensibility without breaking core guarantees.
- SCP SHOULD remain usable across diverse cultural contexts.
- SCP MAY integrate with external systems under strict controls.
- New goals MUST be proposed by umbrella authority and approved through umbrella governance.
- Goal execution MUST be aligned and carried out by communities and field agents.
- Reclassification of non-goals MUST be decided by umbrella role owners.

## Edge Cases

- Requests to embed organization-specific logic into core
- Pressure to relax consent or audit requirements

## Audit & Logs

- Goals and non-goals MUST be documented and version-controlled.
- Deviations SHOULD be recorded with justification.

## Open Questions

- None.
