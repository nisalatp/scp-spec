# 09 Reporting and Charts

This section explains how to build reporting UI.

## 1. Report Builder UI

- Use the reportable entity registry to list fields.
- Allow filters, group by, and aggregations.
- Do not allow raw SQL.

## 2. Saved Reports

- Users can save report definitions.
- Use the report definition status lifecycle.
- Show status badges in the UI.

## 3. Running Reports

- Use the report run API.
- Poll for status until complete.
- Provide download links (CSV or XLSX).

## 4. Charts

- Charts must be based on report definitions.
- Use chart definitions and render endpoints.

## Checklist

- Report builder only shows allowed fields
- Runs are tracked and downloadable
- Charts use the chart definition lifecycle
