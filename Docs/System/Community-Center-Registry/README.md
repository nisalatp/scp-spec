# Community Center Registry

## Purpose
The Community Center Registry defines "Hubs" within a community. Unlike a pure "Facility" (which implies service delivery like a Clinic), a Community Center is a social anchor—a Village Hall, a Religious Center, or a Shelter. It acts as a gathering point and a locus of governance.

## Responsibilities
- **Registration**: Identifying where communities gather.
- **Linkage**: Use as a distribution point (e.g., "Food Distribution at Village Hall A").

## In Scope / Out of Scope
**In Scope**:
- Registering Physical Hubs.
- Linking to Geo Nodes.

**Out of Scope**:
- Managing private homes.

## Key Concepts
- **Community Center**: A registered location for public assembly.

## Component Relationship
- **Facility Registry**: Highly related. Ideally, a Community Center IS A Facility with type "Community Center". This component allows for specialized metadata if needed.
