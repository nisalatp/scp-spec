# Scope & Governance: Marketplace Access

## Scope Rules
- **Explicit Expiry**: Infinite access is Forbidden. Every grant must have an `active_until` date.
- **Purpose Binding**: Access is granted for a specific *Purpose*. Using data for other purposes is a violation.

## Governance Policies
### 1. Least Privilege
- Requests must specify exactly which Verticals and Programs are needed. "All Access" requests are auto-rejected or flagged for High-Level Review.

### 2. Sandbox First
- (Proposed) Partners should test in a Sandbox environment before getting Production Data access.
