# Scope & Governance: Workflows & Case Management

## Scope Rules

### 1. Vertical Isolation
- A "Health Case" is invisible to "Education" workers unless explicitly shared.

### 2. Workflow Versioning
- Workflows are Versioned.
- Case A started on v1 follows v1 logical path.
- Case B started on v2 follows v2.

## Governance Examples
1.  **Allowed**: Health Supervisor approves Health Case.
2.  **Denied**: Education Supervisor approves Health Case (Role Mismatch).
3.  **Allowed**: System auto-closes "Stabilized" cases after 1 year (Policy).

## Governance Logic
- **Approvals**: High-value cases (e.g., >1M LKR) trigger "Umbrella Authority" approval step.
