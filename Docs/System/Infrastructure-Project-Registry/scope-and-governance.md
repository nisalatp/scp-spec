# Scope & Governance: Infrastructure Project Registry

## Scope Rules
- **Multi-Geo**: A Project (e.g., Road) can link to 50 distinct Villages.
- **Time Bound**: Projects *must* have an estimated completion date.

## Governance Policies
### 1. Transparency
- Projects are generally considered Public Record unless tagged `Security Sensitive` (e.g. Defense).

### 2. Vertical Alignment
- A "Water" project must be tagged to the "Water & Sanitation" Vertical for reporting.
