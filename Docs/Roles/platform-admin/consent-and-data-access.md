# Consent & Data Access: Platform Admin

## Consent Types
*   **N/A**: Platform Admins operate on System Metadata, not Subject Data.
*   Therefore, they do not interact with Consent flows.

## Access Revocation
*   If a Platform Admin account is suspended, all API tokens are revoked immediately (`SPEC/04-security/02-authentication.md`).
