# Scope Rules: Umbrella Authority

## Scope Enforcement Examples

*   **Vertical Mismatch**: Umbrella acts *above* verticals, so they don't suffer mismatch blocks for Governance actions.
*   **Operational Constraints**: While they govern all verticals, they cannot perform *operational* actions (like `visit.create`) because they lack the `field-agent` scope context.

## Deny Wins
*   Standard Deny Rules apply.
