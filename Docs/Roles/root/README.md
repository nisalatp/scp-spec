# ROOT (Global Super Admin)

## Purpose
The ROOT account acts as the immutable global super administrator. It is designed for break-glass scenarios, platform initialization, and critical infrastructure maintenance. It bypasses all standard platform checks.

## Responsibilities
- Platform Initialization.
- Emergency "Break-glass" interventions.
- Debugging critical failures inaccessible to normal admins.
- Managing multi-tenant infrastructure.

## Associated Verticals
- All (Bypass).

## Scope Rules
- **Tenant scope**: Global (Can assume any tenant context).
- **Geo scope**: Global.
- **Vertical scope**: Global.
- **Program scope**: Global.

## Permissions Summary
- **Allowed**: **ALL (Wildcard)**.
- **Denied**: **None**.
- **Conditional**: None. ROOT bypasses all conditions.

## Data Access Boundaries
- **PII access**: Unrestricted.
- **Sensitive health data**: Unrestricted.
- **Welfare eligibility data**: Unrestricted.
- **Audit log visibility**: Unrestricted.

## Consent Requirements
- **BYPASS**: ROOT accounts bypass all consent checks.
- Usage of this power must be strictly audited.

## Audit Expectations
- **Elevated Severity**: All ROOT actions are logged with a special high-severity flag.
- **Immutable Log**: Audit logs generated by ROOT cannot be modified (even by ROOT, ideally, subject to physical storage).
- **Target Context**: Audit must record which tenant/vertical was acted upon.

## Typical Workflows / Use Cases
- Recovering a locked-out Tenant Admin.
- Fixing a corrupted database record that blocks normal operations.
- Initial system setup.

## Edge Cases
- Google OAuth failure (locks ROOT out).
